  <title>Building LFS in Stages</title>

  <para>LFS is designed to be built in one session.  That is, the
  instructions assume that the system will not be shut down
  during the process.  That does not mean that the system has to
  be done in one sitting.  The issue is that certain procedures
  have to be re-accomplished after a reboot if resuming LFS at
  different points.</para>
